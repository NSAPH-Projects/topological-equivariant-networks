    Identify minimal cycles in a graph.

    This function finds all cycles in a given graph and then filters out those that contain simpler
    cycles within themselves. It returns minimal cycles, which are those that do not encompass any
    smaller cycle. The minimal cycle length is 3.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : torch.Tensor
        The input graph represented as a PyTorch tensor.

    Returns
    -------
    set[Cell]
        A set of minimal cycles, each cycle is represented as a frozenset of node indices and a
        corresponding feature vector.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the input graph does not contain an edge index 'edge_index'.

    Attributes
    ----------
    num_features : int
        The number of features for each node. It is set to 0, since cycles do not have inherent
        features.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : torch.Tensor
        The input graph represented as a PyTorch tensor.

    Returns
    -------
    set[Cell]
        A set of cells, each representing a ring in the graph. Each cell consists of a frozenset of
        node indices and a feature vector.
