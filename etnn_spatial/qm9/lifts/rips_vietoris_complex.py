    """
    Construct a Rips complex from a graph and returns its simplices.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : object
        A graph object containing vertices 'x' and their positions 'pos'.
    dim : int
        Maximum dimension of simplices in the Rips complex.
    dis : float
        Maximum distance between any two points in a simplex.
    fc_nodes : bool, optional
        If True, force inclusion of all edges as 1-dimensional simplices. Default is True.

    Returns
    -------
    set[Cell]
        A set of Cells, where each Cell represents a simplex in the Rips complex. Each simplex is a
        frozenset of vertex indices accompanied by a 0-dimensional feature vector.

    Attributes
    ----------
    num_features : int
        The number of features for each node.

    Notes
    -----
    The function uses the `gudhi` library to construct the Rips complex. It first converts the graph
    positions to a list of points, then generates the Rips complex and its simplex tree up to the
    specified dimension and edge length. Optionally, it includes all nodes as 0-dimensional
    simplices. Finally, it extracts and returns the simplices from the simplex tree.
